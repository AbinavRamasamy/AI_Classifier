# AI Classifier
A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based character classification system designed to distinguish between human-written text and computer-generated text with remarkable precision. This project combines advanced deep learning techniques with large-scale dataset preprocessing to deliver highly accurate results.

It explores the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing by converting textual data into image representations, allowing the model to learn subtle differences in character shapes, styles, and rendering patterns.

# Features
